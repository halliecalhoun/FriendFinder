# FriendFinder


# Description
This app is a compatibility-based "FriendFinder" application -- basically a dating app. This full-stack site will take in results from users' surveys, then compare their answers with those from other users. The app will then display the name and picture of the user with the best overall match. Express is used to handle routing. 

# How It Works
* Complete the survey answering all questions
* Enter your information to begin, including your name and a link to your photo
* Continue on to the survey portion answering all 10 questions
* Answers range from a scale of 1 to 5 based on how much the user agrees or disagrees with a question
* Upon survey submission, the app will calculate your best friend match based on compatibility scores and display your best match
